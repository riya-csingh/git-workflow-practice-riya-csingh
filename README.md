The [article] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateharrison/2018/05/09/what-your-startup-needs-to-know-about-predictive-analytics-it-is-not-as-scary-as-it-sounds/?sh=5f47665371a0) I selected is from an interview with my Intro to CS professor at NYU who inspired me to pursue computer science. 
The article is more in an interview format which makes it quite engaging and easy to follow. In this article, he discusses a branch of artificial intelligence–predictive analytics–geared specifically to small businesses. I’m particularly interested in this because my parents are small business owners and I like to learn new technologies that can support them and their business. 

He gives some cool examples of how he helped a local coffee shop in NYC improve decision-making and cut losses using predictive analytics. He utilized several algorithms such as data clustering to determine customer segmentation to reduce marketing costs for loyal customers. The association rules algorithm was used to understand customer behavior to offer specials and strategic product placement to retain, motivate, and personalize the customer experience. He also explains succinctly the logic behind the specific algorithms such as “Flock by Leader” and “Uplift modeling.” He gives some great advice and opportunities for small businesses to deploy predictive models into their operations and strategic objectives.
